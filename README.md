Programs for Python Practice

Creating a simple contact book (also known as an address book) in Python can be a great beginner's project. In this example, we'll use a dictionary to store contacts, where each contact will have a name as the key and a list of details (like phone number, email, etc.) as the associated value. We'll also provide basic operations for adding, deleting, searching, and displaying contacts. 

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Initialize an empty contact book (dictionary)
2. Function to add a new contact
3. Function to delete a contact
4. Function to search a contact
5. Function to display all contacts
6. Main menu to display all fuctions
